Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end,<br> each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.<br> The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled<br> at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fiel<br>ding side tries to prevent this (by preventing<br> the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket)<br> and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hM<br>its the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side<br> either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and b<br>efore it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter c<br>an cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismiss
<br>ed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by<br> a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
